# Hydac project

In our first introduction to project work, we collaborated with HYDAC on a case about developing a come-and-go system for employees. We had to prepare a console application with a quality control structure, data conversion, and the option to save data in a text file. It was a nice little project that lasted for 5 weeks, with a focus on project management, system development, and basic object-oriented programming in C#.
