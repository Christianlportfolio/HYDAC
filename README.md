# Hydac-kode

Our first introduction to project work in a real project was in collaboration with HYDAC. It concerned a case about the development of a come-go system of employees for the company. Here we had to prepare a console application with quality of control structure, data conversion and with the option of persistence ie. the option to save data in a text file. A nice little project over 5 weeks with a focus on project management, system development and basic object-oriented programming in C#.
